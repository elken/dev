As a Devon-based technologist with a fervent passion for Clojure and Emacs, and
an equally strong love for bass and music; I stand at the unique crossroads of
coding and creativity.

Throughout my career, I've navigated a diverse array of projects in both web and
desktop environments. From developing complex enterprise-level solutions to
crafting elegant, user-friendly interfaces, my experience is as varied as it is
deep. Notably, my proficiency in Clojure has enabled me to write clean,
efficient code; while Emacs has been my faithful companion in streamlining my
workflow.

I'm driven by the continuous pursuit of knowledge and the satisfaction of
overcoming challenges. Whether it's refining a tricky piece of code or mastering
a complex bass line, I relish in the thrill of achievement. Looking ahead, I aim
to blend these worlds even further, creating harmonious solutions that resonate
both technically and creatively.
